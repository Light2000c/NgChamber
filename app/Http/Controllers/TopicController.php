        <p>Agriculture is a major sector of the Nigerian economy, employing about 70% of the population and contributing about 23% to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nigeria is a leader in various types of agricultural production, given its vast arable land, large population, and diverse climatic conditions. The sector is dominated by small-scale farmers who produce crops such as cassava, rice, maize, yams, pineapple, palm sorghum, vegetables, and a vast majority of other agricultural produce, but there are opportunities for investment in large-scale commercial farming, agribusiness, and value-added processing.  The government has identified agriculture as a key sector for economic growth and has launched various initiatives to promote investment in the sector.</p>
        <p> There are opportunities for investment in areas such as mechanized farming, irrigation systems, food processing, crop processing, storage and packaging, and export.
